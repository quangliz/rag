            "\n",
            "1. **Bias and Fairness**: AI systems can inherit and amplify biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n",
            "2. **Lack of Transparency and Explainability**: Many AI systems, particularly deep learning models, are \"black boxes,\" making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions, which can lead to a lack of trust and accountability.\n",
            "3. **Privacy and Data Protection**: AI systems often rely on large amounts of data, raising concerns about privacy and data protection, and ensuring responsible data handling, implementing privacy-preserving techniques, and complying with data protection regulations.\n",
            "4. **Accountability and Responsibility**: Establishing accountability and responsibility for AI systems is essential for addressing potential harms and ensuring ethical behavior, including defining roles and responsibilities for developers, deployers, and users of AI systems.\n",
            "5. **Social Impact**: AI has the potential to exacerbate existing social inequalities and disparities, particularly in areas such as healthcare, education, and employment.\n",
            "6. **Autonomous Weapons**: The use of AI in autonomous weapons systems raises significant ethical and security concerns, and international discussions and regulations are needed to address the risks associated with AI-powered weapons.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Reference Answer**: This response is the most accurate, comprehensive, and relevant to the query. It covers a wide range of ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI in decision-making, including bias, transparency, explainability, privacy, job displacement, accountability, and social impact. The reference answer also highlights the importance of ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Standard Response**: This response is comprehensive and covers most of the key ethical concerns surrounding AI in decision-making. It includes bias and fairness, transparency and explainability, robustness and reliability, user control and agency, ethical design and development, addressing bias in AI, transparency and explainability, privacy and data security, accountability, and social impact. However, it lacks some specific details and examples, making it slightly less detailed than the reference answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Selective Response**: This response is concise and covers some of the key ethical concerns surrounding AI in decision-making, including bias and fairness, transparency and explainability, privacy and data security, job displacement, accountability, and autonomy and control issues. However, it omits some important concerns, such as respect for human rights, non-discrimination, and public perception and trust. This response also lacks specific details and examples.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Summary Response**: This response is concise but lacks the depth and breadth of the reference and standard responses. It covers some of the key ethical concerns, including bias and fairness, transparency and explainability, privacy and data security, job displacement, autonomy and control issues, accountability, and social impact. However, it does not provide specific details or examples, and some concerns are not mentioned at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Extraction Response**: This response is the least comprehensive and most superficial of the four. It only covers a few key concerns, including bias and fairness, lack of transparency and explainability, privacy and data protection, accountability, social impact, and autonomous weapons. The response lacks specific details, examples, and other important concerns, making it the least accurate and relevant to the query.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the reference answer is the most accurate, comprehensive, and relevant to the query, followed by the standard response. The selective and summary responses are less comprehensive, while the extraction response is the least comprehensive and most superficial.\n"
