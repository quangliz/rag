    "# Fusion Retrieval: Combining Vector and Keyword Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I implement a fusion retrieval system that combines the strengths of semantic vector search with keyword-based BM25 retrieval. This approach improves retrieval quality by capturing both conceptual similarity and exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Fusion Retrieval Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems typically rely on vector search alone, but this has limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector search excels at semantic similarity but may miss exact keyword matches\n",
    "- Keyword search is great for specific terms but lacks semantic understanding\n",
    "- Different queries perform better with different retrieval methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Fusion retrieval gives us the best of both worlds by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performing both vector-based and keyword-based retrieval\n",
    "- Normalizing the scores from each approach\n",
    "- Combining them with a weighted formula\n",
    "- Ranking documents based on the combined score"

      "\n",
      "**Reasons:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Comprehensive and Accurate Definition:** Like the vector approach, it successfully defined 'Explainable AI' accurately and clearly, aligning with the reference answer. This indicates that the semantic understanding component (likely from the vector part) was effective.\n",
      "2.  **Superior Explanation of Importance:** The fusion response excelled in explaining *why* XAI is important. It not only covered the core aspects of trust, accountability, and fairness (as in the reference and vector response) but also seamlessly integrated the critical concept of \"black box\" AI models as a primary driver for XAI's necessity. This integration was more concise and impactful than in the vector response, which had some redundancy.\n",
      "3.  **Optimal Balance:** It avoided the pitfalls of pure keyword matching (like BM25's failure to define XAI) and improved upon the slight redundancy of the pure vector approach. By combining both methods, it likely retrieved a richer set of relevant documents (due to keyword hits) and then semantically understood and synthesized the information more effectively.\n",
      "4.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** The fusion response was the most articulate and well-structured, providing a complete answer without unnecessary repetition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **BM25 keyword retrieval** performed worst because it failed to answer the definitional part of the query and provided only a fragmented, quoted answer for the importance, highlighting its limitation when direct keyword matches for a definition are not present or when synthesis is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Vector-based retrieval** performed very well, providing a largely correct and comprehensive answer. Its only minor drawback was a slight redundancy in explaining the importance. However, the fusion approach managed to present the same information more concisely and effectively.\n",

      "*   **Vector-based:** Its strength lies in semantic understanding. It correctly identifies the lack of *specific* information about earthquake prediction, even while retrieving broader, semantically related concepts like \"disaster response.\" Its weakness is that the supporting evidence for the *absence* of earthquake prediction is less direct; it states what *is* there (general disaster response) and then what *isn't* (specific earthquake prediction). It's good, but not as strong in providing *negative evidence* as the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **BM25 keyword:** This approach excels at identifying the precise absence of keywords. It directly states that \"no mention\" of earthquake prediction exists. Its strength is then reinforced by listing *other* specific applications that *are* mentioned (climate change, poverty, healthcare disparities). This provides strong contextual evidence for why earthquake prediction isn't covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fusion retrieval:** This approach combines the strengths of both. It directly states the absence of information, similar to BM25. Crucially, it then provides the *most comprehensive* list of what *is* mentioned in the context (healthcare, finance, transportation, retail, manufacturing, *and* social good challenges like climate change, poverty, healthcare disparities). This extensive list of *other* applications makes the absence of earthquake prediction even more definitive and well-supported.

      "**Why:**\n",
      "1.  **Semantic Understanding:** The query \"What is a 'cobot'?\" benefits greatly from semantic understanding. While \"cobot\" might be a specific term, the definition often involves concepts like \"collaborative,\" \"human-robot interaction,\" and \"industrial robots.\" Vector-based retrieval excels at understanding the meaning and context of words, allowing it to retrieve documents that semantically relate to \"cobot\" even if the exact phrase isn't heavily present or if the definition is spread across different parts of the text.\n",
      "2.  **Alignment with Reference Answer:** The vector-based response successfully extracted the information that the reference answer indicated was present in the context. It correctly identified the key characteristics of a cobot.\n",
      "3.  **Overcoming Keyword Limitations:** BM25, being a keyword-based method, likely failed because the exact term \"cobot\" or its direct definition might not have been prominent enough for a high score, or the relevant information was described using synonyms or related concepts that BM25 couldn't bridge.\n",
      "4.  **Fusion Failure:** The most surprising outcome is the failure of the Fusion approach. Since the vector component *did* find the information, the fusion logic must have somehow overridden or discarded this correct retrieval, perhaps due to a strong negative signal from the BM25 component or an ineffective weighting strategy. This highlights that fusion isn't always a guaranteed improvement and its implementation details matter significantly.\n",

It provided the most comprehensive and informative \"negative\" response by acknowledging the query, stating the absence of specific information, and also pointing to a related concept that *was* found in the context. This suggests a more robust understanding of the query's domain, even when the precise answer is unavailable. The Vector-based approach was a close second for similar reasons, while BM25 was the least helpful as it simply stated the absence of information without any additional context.\n",

      "### 1. Vector-based Retrieval (Semantic Similarity)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **How it works:** Converts queries and documents into numerical vectors (embeddings) and finds documents whose vectors are \"closest\" to the query vector in a high-dimensional space. Focuses on the meaning and context.\n",
      "*   **Types of Queries where it performs best:**\n",
      "    *   **Conceptual/Abstract Queries:** Queries that require understanding the underlying meaning rather than just keyword matching (e.g., \"What is 'Explainable AI' and why is it considered important?\", \"How does AI contribute to personalized medicine?\").\n",
      "    *   **Queries with Synonyms or Rephrasing:** When the user uses different words than those in the document but means the same thing.\n",
      "    *   **Broad Topics:** Good for retrieving documents that discuss a topic generally, even if specific keywords aren't present.\n",
      "*   **Overall Strengths:**\n",
      "    *   **Semantic Understanding:** Excels at grasping the intent behind a query, even if the exact keywords aren't used.\n",
      "    *   **Handles Vocabulary Mismatch:** Overcomes the problem where the user's language differs from the document's.\n",
      "    *   **Improved Recall:** Can retrieve relevant documents that BM25 might miss due to keyword absence.\n",
      "*   **Overall Weaknesses:**\n",
      "    *   **Less Precise for Specific Facts:** Can sometimes be too broad, potentially retrieving conceptually related but factually irrelevant documents if the embeddings aren't highly tuned.\n",
      "    *   **Performance Dependency:** Heavily reliant on the quality of the embedding model.\n",
      "    *   **\"Hallucination\" Risk (in RAG context):** If the retrieved context is too broad or semantically similar but factually incorrect, the LLM might generate plausible but wrong answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. BM25 Keyword Retrieval (Keyword Matching)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **How it works:** A statistical method that ranks documents based on the frequency and inverse document frequency of query terms within the documents, along with document length normalization. Focuses on exact word matches.\n",
      "*   **Types of Queries where it performs best:**\n",
      "    *   **Specific Factual Lookups:** Queries asking for precise information, names, acronyms, or definitions (e.g., \"What is a 'cobot'?\", \"What is Direct Air Capture (DAC) used for?\").\n",
      "    *   **Queries with Unique Identifiers:** When the query contains specific terms that are likely to appear verbatim in the relevant documents.\n",
      "    *   **Identifying Absence of Information:** Can be effective in determining if a specific keyword or phrase is *not* present in the document collection (e.g., \"Does the document mention any specific companies developing AI technology?\").\n",
      "*   **Overall Strengths:**\n",
      "    *   **Precision for Keyword-Rich Queries:** Highly effective when the query terms are explicitly present in the relevant documents.\n",
      "    *   **Fast and Transparent:** Computationally efficient and easy to understand why a document was retrieved.\n",
      "    *   **Good for \"Negative\" Queries:** Can reliably indicate if a specific piece of information (identified by keywords) is absent.\n",
      "*   **Overall Weaknesses:**\n",
      "    *   **Vocabulary Mismatch:** Fails if the user uses synonyms or rephrases the query, even if the meaning is the same.\n",
      "    *   **Lack of Semantic Understanding:** Cannot infer relationships between words or understand context beyond exact matches.\n",
      "    *   **Poor for Conceptual Queries:** Struggles with abstract or general questions that don't rely on specific keywords.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Fusion Retrieval (Combination of Both)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **How it works:** Combines the results from both Vector-based and BM25 retrieval methods, often using techniques like Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) or weighted sum, to produce a final ranked list of documents.\n",
      "*   **Types of Queries where it performs best:**\n",
      "    *   **General-Purpose/Diverse Queries:** Excels when the types of queries are varied, encompassing both conceptual and factual questions.\n",
      "    *   **Robustness:** Provides a more consistent and reliable performance across a wide range of query types, mitigating the weaknesses of individual methods.\n",
      "    *   **Queries where both semantic and keyword signals are important:** For example, a query that is conceptual but also contains a specific term.\n",
      "*   **Overall Strengths:**\n",
      "    *   **Balances Precision and Recall:** Leverages BM25 for precise keyword matches and Vector for semantic understanding, leading to a more comprehensive and relevant set of retrieved documents.\n",
      "    *   **Increased Robustness:** Less prone to catastrophic failure on specific query types. If one method performs poorly, the other can often compensate.\n",
      "    *   **Improved Overall Performance:** As seen in Query 10 (\"Is AI currently being used to control nuclear weapons systems?\"), fusion often performs as well as the best individual method, and sometimes better, by combining their strengths. The summary for Query 10 explicitly states all three approaches produced \"very similar and highly accurate responses,\" suggesting fusion maintained high performance.\n",
      "*   **Overall Weaknesses:**\n",
      "    *   **Increased Complexity:** More complex to implement and tune, especially regarding the weighting or fusion strategy.\n",
      "    *   **Marginal Gains:** For some very specific query types where one method is overwhelmingly superior, the fusion might offer only marginal gains or even slight degradation if not tuned correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How Fusion Retrieval Balances the Trade-offs\n",
      "\n",
      "Fusion retrieval directly addresses the inherent trade-offs between BM25's precision (for keywords) and Vector's recall (for semantics).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Mitigating Vocabulary Mismatch:** If a user asks a conceptual question using different words, the vector component can still find relevant documents.\n",
      "*   **Ensuring Factual Accuracy:** If a user asks a very specific factual question, the BM25 component ensures that documents containing those exact terms are highly ranked, preventing the vector component from retrieving only semantically similar but factually distinct information.\n",
      "*   **Handling Ambiguity:** For queries that could be interpreted in multiple ways, fusion can bring in documents from both keyword and semantic perspectives, providing a richer context for the LLM to synthesize an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, fusion acts as a safety net, ensuring that the system doesn't miss relevant information due to the limitations of a single retrieval approach. It provides a more resilient and adaptable retrieval layer for a RAG system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for When to Use Each Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **BM25 Keyword Retrieval:**\n",
      "    *   **Use when:** Your document collection is highly structured, and queries are primarily factual, specific, or involve unique identifiers, names, or acronyms.\n",
      "    *   **Example Use Case:** Internal knowledge bases where users search for specific policy numbers, product names, or definitions.\n",
      "    *   **Consideration:** If your users tend to use very precise language that matches your document content.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Vector-based Retrieval:**\n",
      "    *   **Use when:** Your document collection is diverse, and queries are often conceptual, open-ended, or involve natural language that may not perfectly match document keywords.\n",
      "    *   **Example Use Case:** Customer support chatbots where users ask questions in varied ways, or research systems where users explore broad topics.\n",
      "    *   **Consideration:** Requires a good quality embedding model and can be more computationally intensive for indexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Fusion Retrieval:**\n",
      "    *   **Use when:** You need a robust, general-purpose retrieval system that can handle a wide variety of query types. This is often the **recommended default** for most modern RAG applications.\n",
      "    *   **Example Use Case:** Public-facing Q&A systems, comprehensive knowledge management platforms, or any application where query diversity is high and consistent performance is critical.\n",
      "    *   **Consideration:** While more complex to set up initially, the benefits of improved accuracy and robustness across diverse queries usually outweigh the added complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while individual methods have their niches, **Fusion Retrieval emerges as the most versatile and robust approach** for a RAG system, effectively balancing the strengths of keyword matching and semantic understanding to provide consistently high-quality results across a broad spectrum of user queries.\n"
